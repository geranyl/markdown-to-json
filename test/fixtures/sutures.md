# Sutures #

Suture selection is based on tissue type. Considerations include how long tensile strength must be retained and how much tissue reactivity the material will cause. 
Generally synthetic materials are less reactive and cause less tissue irritation. 

Sutures are classified by how many filaments they have and by what material they are made of. Monofilament is less likely to harbour microbes than multifilament, but can be hard to tie securely. The material type determines how a suture breaks down. Absorbable sutures are broken down by proteolysis (natural suture materials), or hydrolysis (synthetic materials). 

Suture size is based on thread diameter. The large the number, the thinner the thread. E.g. 8-0 - microvascular surgery, 2-0 deep tissues like bowel.

Needles attached to suturing thread are either tapered, conventional cutting, or reverse cutting. Cutting needles should only be used with skin, all other tissue should use a tapered needle so that tissue is not torn through.

Some common synthetic suture materials:
(*fa = fully absorbed*)

| Material  |  Absorbable?	|  Retention of Tensile Strength	| Tissue Rx	| Use	|  
|  ------	| :------:	| ------	| ------	| ------	|  
| Demalon (nylon)	|  N	|  - 	|  low 	| cutaneous	|  
| Prolene (polypropylene)	| N	| -	| low	| cutaneous  
| Mersilene (polyester)	| N	| -	| low  	| soft tissue (long term approximation)	| 
| Monocryl (poliglecaprone)	| Y	| 50% at 1 wk, 20% at 2 wks, fa in 100d	| minimal	| cutaneous
| Vicryl (lactide and glycoside)	|Y | 60% at 2 wks, 8% at 4 wks, fa in 60-90d	| mild-moderate (less than catgut)	|  cutaneous (not the purple coated), soft tissue |  
| PDS (poly p-dioxanone) 	| Y|70% at 2 wks, 50% at 4 wks, 25% at 6 wks, fa in 180d	| minimal| soft tissue requiring extended approximation, fascia |  

Some common natural materials:

| Material  |  Absorbable?	|  Retention of Tensile Strength	| Tissue Rx	| Use	|  
|  ------	| :------:	| ------	| ------	| ------	|  
| silk	| N	| 2 years	| moderate	| soft tissue approximation/ligation	|  
| catgut	| Y	| 7-10 days, fa 70 days	| moderate	| soft tissue	|  
| chromic gut	| Y	| 14 days, fa 90 days	| moderate (< plain gut)	|  soft tissue approximation/ligation

## General Rules ##

* 3-0 or 4-0 sutures are used for skin on the torso and extremities
* 5-0 or 6-0 sutures are used for skin on the face and neck
* 2-0 to 4-0  sutures are used for closure of deeper tissues
* non-absorbable sutures should be removed in:
	* 7-10 days - torso and extremities
	* 4 days - face and neck
* cosmetic procedures use non-absorbable sutures
